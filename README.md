# TruthTablesGenerator
A Boolean Algebra Truth Tables generator for use in computer science classes

It may not have been a wise decision, but instead of working on filling in my
monotonously boring truth tables, I decided to write a program to finish them
for me! This is just a basic program that I tried to write as fast as I could,
so it is in no way perfect. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to send
me an email.
